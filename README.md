## Installation ##

In your Gemfile add the following:

```ruby
gem 'dismissible_helpers'
```

## Usage ##

### Default Behavior ###

By default, DismissibleHelpers will use cookies to track the state of
the dismissed helpers. 

### Using authenticated user ###

DismissibleHelpers will store the dismissed helpers on a model. The
model should have an attribute called `dismissed_helpers` which should
be an array type. You can use ActiveRecord's serialization to achive
this:

 1 Add this `dismissed_helpers` column as a `text` column

```ruby
class AddDismissedHelpersToAccounts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    add_column :accounts, :dismissed_helpers, :text
  end

  def down
    remove_column :accounts, :dismissed_helpers
  end
end
```

 2 Add the serization call to the model

```ruby
class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
  serialize :dismissed_helpers, Array
end
```

If you are using PostgreSQL as your database, you could use
`postgres\_ext` to add native array support to your models. You would
just need the following migration to add the dismissed_helpers attribute
to your model:

```ruby
class AddDismissedHelpersToAccounts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    add_column :accounts, :dismissed_helpers, :string, :array => true
  end

  def down
    remove_column :accounts, :dismissed_helpers
  end
end
```

Your model does not need to be called Account, it just needs the
`dismissed\_helpers` attribute.

### Retrieving the current account/user ###

If the helper method `current_account` is available, DismissibleHelpers
will use this to retrieve the current user/account.
